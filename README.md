## General Information
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Conclusions
- Real world data is expected to have class imbalance issues and also with has classes with very small sample sizes.
- This can be a challence in training high performance models (Accuracy and Generalizability) 
- Using appropriate data augmentation techniques it is possible to improve the model performance.
